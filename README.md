# LeetCode & CodeStudio DSA Exercises

This repository contains Java-based solutions for various data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems from platforms like LeetCode and CodeStudio. Each file is named after the specific task, making it easy to track the problems and solutions.

## Structure

- **LeetCode Problems**: Java files corresponding to specific LeetCode exercises.
- **CodeStudio Problems**: Tasks sourced from CodeStudio with solution files.

### Examples of Problems Solved

- `MergeKSortedLists.java`: Merges `k` sorted linked lists into one sorted list with an efficient time complexity using a priority queue.
- `LongestValidParentheses.java`: Finds the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring in a given string.
- `WordLadder.java`: Implements the solution for transforming one word into another using the shortest sequence of transformations from a given word list.
- `TrappingRainWater.java`: Solves the problem of calculating how much water can be trapped after rainfall given an elevation map.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LupusEternus/LeetCodeExercises.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Navigate to the `src/` directory and run the desired problem solution.

### Platforms Covered

- **LeetCode**: A platform offering a vast collection of DSA problems of varying difficulty.
