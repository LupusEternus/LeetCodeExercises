# LeetCode & CodeStudio DSA Exercises

This repository contains Java-based solutions for various data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems from platforms like LeetCode and CodeStudio. Each file is named after the specific task, making it easy to track the problems and solutions.

## Structure

- **LeetCode Problems**: Java files corresponding to specific LeetCode exercises.
- **CodeStudio Problems**: Tasks sourced from CodeStudio with solution files.

### Examples of Problems Solved

- `TwoSum.java`: Solves the "Two Sum" problem by finding two numbers in an array that add up to a target.
- `ReverseInteger.java`: Implements a solution to reverse digits of an integer.
- `PalindromeLinkedList.java`: Checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
- `SearchInRotatedSortedArray.java`: Finds a target element in a rotated sorted array.
